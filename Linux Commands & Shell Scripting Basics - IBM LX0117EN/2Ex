Exercise 1 - Create and execute a basic Shell Script

In this exercise, we will create a simple script which will do the following.

    Accept a user name
    Print a welcome message to the user

We will also add comments to the script. All the lines starting with # are comments. They are not executed by the shell. Comments make a shell script more readable, and help in debugging the script.

1.1 Create a new script file

Step 1: On the menu on the lab screen, use File->New File to create a new file.

Step 2: Give the name as 'greet.sh' and click 'OK'

Step 3: Copy and paste the following lines into the newly created file.

# This script accepts the user's name and prints 
# a message greeting the user

# Print the prompt message on screen
echo -n "Enter your name :"        

# Wait for user to enter a name, and save the entered name into the variable 'name'
read name                

# Print the welcome message followed by the name    
echo "Welcome $name"

# The following message should print on a single line. Hence the usage of '-n'
echo -n "Congratulations! You just created and ran your first shell script "
echo "using Bash on IBM Skills Network"
